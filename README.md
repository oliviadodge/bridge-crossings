# bridge-crossings

This is the first Android app I built. The goal is to allow a user to track when and how often they cross bridge tolls. They can then configure the app to send an e-mail with the data to a contact of their choice. The app uses many of the principles and features I learned about in the Big Nerd Ranch Guide, including activities and fragments and saving and storing data.
