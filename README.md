# bridge-crossings

This is the first Android app I built in the days before I started using git. Click [here] (https://goo.gl/photos/d89dNTbuznYB8bxY9) to see screenshots. The goal of the app is to allow a user to track when and how often they cross bridge tolls. They can then configure the app to send an e-mail with the data to a contact of their choice. The app uses many of the principles and features I learned about in the Big Nerd Ranch Guide, including activities, fragments, intents, and saving and storing data.

Possible future addition: implement geo-fencing to detect when a user is crossing a toll bridge so tolls can be automatically stored insetad of manually entered as it is now.
